First install the computer with a iso from void.

https://voidlinux.org/download/


update the packages when you have rebooted the computer
xbps-install -Suv
Run the install.sh to install some nice features, like htop, telnet, mc etc etc



The default DE/Window manager is xfce and Ive configured this and made a tarball of it
You can download it and install the .tar file





Troubleshooting
Cannot login to xfce and no network
generate a conf file with your wifi ssid and password
sudo wpa that one
